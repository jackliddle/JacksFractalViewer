# Jacks Fractal Viewer

A simple, interactive fractal visualization tool built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application was created as a collaboration between human (Jack) and AI (Claude/Cline) and allows you to explore the fascinating world of fractals without requiring any backend server or additional dependencies.

**Live Demo**: [https://jackliddle.github.io/JacksFractalViewer/](https://jackliddle.github.io/JacksFractalViewer/)

## Features

- **Multiple Fractal Types**: Explore three different fractal types:
  - **Mandelbrot Set**: The classic fractal that started it all
  - **Julia Set**: Related to the Mandelbrot set but with fixed complex constants
  - **Burning Ship**: A variation that creates a distinctive "burning ship" appearance

- **Interactive Zooming**: Click anywhere on the fractal to create a selection box, then zoom in to explore the infinite detail of these mathematical wonders.

- **Color Schemes**: Visualize the fractals with three different color schemes:
  - **Spectrum Blue**: A gradient from blue to purple
  - **Fire**: A warm gradient from yellow to red
  - **Rainbow**: A full spectrum of colors cycling through all hues

- **Responsive Controls**: Simple, intuitive controls for selecting fractal types, color schemes, zooming, and resetting the view.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

2. **Select a Fractal Type**: Use the dropdown menu to choose between Mandelbrot Set, Julia Set, or Burning Ship fractal.

3. **Choose a Color Scheme**: Select your preferred color scheme from the dropdown menu.

4. **Zoom In**: Click anywhere on the fractal to create a selection box around that area, then click the "Zoom to Selection" button to zoom in.

5. **Reset View**: Click the "Reset View" button to return to the initial view of the selected fractal.

## AI Development Journey

This project was developed entirely through collaboration with Claude/Cline AI:

- **Initial Version**: Started with a basic fractal renderer, which worked but had some color scheme issues
- **Enhancements**: Added more fractal types (Julia set, Burning Ship) and color schemes based on AI suggestions
- **Refinements**: Fixed color rendering issues with AI-proposed solutions
- **Finalization**: Added proper naming and documentation

The entire codebase, including the complex mathematics for fractal rendering, color mapping, and interactive UI elements, was generated by AI under human guidance.

## Technical Implementation

This application is built using:

- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the fractals pixel by pixel
- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For all the calculations and interactivity

The fractal rendering is done by:

1. Mapping each pixel on the canvas to a point in the complex plane
2. Applying the specific fractal formula to determine if the point is in the set
3. Coloring the pixel based on the number of iterations before the point escapes
4. Using HSL to RGB color conversion for smooth, visually appealing gradients

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

- Add more fractal types (Newton, Tricorn, etc.)
- Implement more color schemes and custom color mapping
- Add the ability to adjust the Julia set constant interactively
- Implement Web Workers for improved performance on complex calculations
- Add the ability to save and share specific views
- Add touch support for mobile devices
