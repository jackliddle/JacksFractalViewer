# Jack's Fractal Viewer

An interactive fractal visualization tool built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is an AI-assisted coding experiment, including this README, created through collaboration between human (Jack) and AI ([Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/) via [Cline](https://cline.bot/)).

**Live Demo**: [https://jackliddle.github.io/JacksFractalViewer/](https://jackliddle.github.io/JacksFractalViewer/)

## AI Coding Experiment

This entire project, from concept to implementation, was developed through AI-human collaboration:

- **Code Generation**: All JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was generated by [Claude AI](https://www.anthropic.com/) through the [Cline](https://cline.bot/) interface
- **Architecture Design**: The plugin-based architecture was designed collaboratively
- **Problem Solving**: Complex mathematical implementations and rendering optimizations were AI-assisted
- **Documentation**: Even this README was written by AI based on analyzing the codebase

The project demonstrates how AI can assist in creating complex, interactive web applications with sophisticated mathematics and extensible architecture.

## Features

- **Multiple Fractal Types**: Explore five different fractal types:
  - **Mandelbrot Set**: The classic fractal that started it all
  - **Julia Set**: Related to the Mandelbrot set but with fixed complex constants
  - **Burning Ship**: A variation that creates a distinctive "burning ship" appearance
  - **Nova Fractal**: Based on Newton's method with multiple roots
  - **Phoenix Fractal**: A complex fractal with intricate patterns

- **Interactive Exploration**: 
  - Click anywhere on the fractal to zoom in
  - Fullscreen mode for immersive exploration
  - Keyboard shortcuts (R for reset, F11 for fullscreen)
  - Touch support with pinch-to-zoom for mobile devices

- **Multiple Color Schemes**: Visualize the fractals with five different color schemes:
  - **Rainbow**: A full spectrum of colors cycling through all hues
  - **Spectrum Blue**: A gradient from blue to purple
  - **Fire**: A warm gradient from yellow to red
  - **Neon**: Bright, vibrant colors with high contrast
  - **Ocean**: Cool blue and green tones

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Progressive rendering for immediate feedback
  - Optimized calculation algorithms
  - Efficient canvas rendering

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular, plugin-based architecture that makes it highly extensible:

### Core Components

1. **FractalViewer**: Main application class that initializes and coordinates all components
2. **PluginRegistry**: Manages registration and retrieval of fractal and color scheme plugins
3. **FractalRenderer**: Handles the mathematical calculations and canvas rendering
4. **UI**: Manages user interactions, controls, and display updates

### Plugin System

The plugin system allows for easy extension with new fractals and color schemes:

- **Base Classes**: `FractalBase` and `ColorSchemeBase` provide interfaces for creating new plugins
- **Registration**: Plugins are registered with the `PluginRegistry` and can be dynamically loaded
- **Standardized API**: All plugins follow a consistent interface for seamless integration

### Rendering Pipeline

1. The renderer maps each pixel on the canvas to a point in the complex plane
2. The selected fractal's `calculate()` method determines the iteration count for that point
3. The selected color scheme's `getColor()` method maps the iteration count to an RGB color
4. The renderer efficiently updates the canvas with the calculated colors

## Extensibility

The project is designed to be easily extended with new fractals and color schemes:

### Adding a New Fractal

To add a new fractal, create a class that extends `FractalBase` and implements:
- `calculate(cReal, cImag)`: The core algorithm that determines if a point is in the fractal
- `getDefaultBoundaries()`: The initial view boundaries for the fractal
- `name` and `description`: For display in the UI

Example (from plugin-example.js):
```javascript
import { FractalBase } from './js/plugins/fractals/base.js';

export class NewtonFractal extends FractalBase {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        super(options);
        this.name = "Newton Fractal";
        this.description = "Newton's method applied to z^3 - 1";
    }
    
    getDefaultBoundaries() {
        return {
            xMin: -2,
            xMax: 2,
            yMin: -2,
            yMax: 2
        };
    }
    
    calculate(cReal, cImag) {
        // Fractal calculation algorithm
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Adding a New Color Scheme

To add a new color scheme, create a class that extends `ColorSchemeBase` and implements:
- `getColor(iterations)`: Maps iteration count to an RGB color
- `name` and `description`: For display in the UI

### Dynamic Loading

The application supports dynamic loading of external plugins:
```javascript
// Load an external fractal plugin
window.fractalViewer.loadExternalPlugin('path/to/my-fractal.js', 'fractal');

// Load an external color scheme plugin
window.fractalViewer.loadExternalPlugin('path/to/my-color-scheme.js', 'colorScheme');
```

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. **Select a Fractal Type**: Use the dropdown menu to choose between different fractal types.
3. **Choose a Color Scheme**: Select your preferred color scheme from the dropdown menu.
4. **Explore**: Click anywhere on the fractal to zoom in on that area.
5. **Reset View**: Click the "Reset View" button (or press R) to return to the initial view.
6. **Fullscreen**: Click the "Fullscreen" button (or press F11) for an immersive experience.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

- Add more fractal types (Tricorn, Multibrot, etc.)
- Implement more color schemes and custom color mapping
- Add the ability to adjust the Julia set constant interactively
- Implement Web Workers for improved performance on complex calculations
- Add the ability to save and share specific views
- Add animation capabilities for parameter changes
